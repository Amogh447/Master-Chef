Stir together warm water, sugar, and yeast and let rise for about 5 minutes.
Mix together the rest of the sugar donut ingredients, including the proofed yeast. Itâ€™s best if you use a dough hook attachment to do this.
Form the dough into a large ball and butter it to prevent skin from forming. Then put it in a covered bowl and keep in a warm place for about 1.5-2 hours.
Roll out the sugar donut dough and use a 3 inch cookie cutter to cut out donuts.
Let rise again for about an hour, until doubled or tripled in volume.
Heat your oil and fry the donuts. Once they are cool enough, roll them in sugar.
Eat and enjoy!
